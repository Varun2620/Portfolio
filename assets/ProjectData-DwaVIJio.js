                        Developed a user recognition system using Python to identify users and allow them to rate 
                        applications, preventing bot reviews. Implemented a secure authentication mechanism to 
                        verify user identities, resulting in a 10% reduction in fraudulent reviews.

                        Implemented an auto-save feature using local storage to prevent data loss, resulting 
                        in a 99% data retention rate during unexpected browser closures.

                        Used component-based design for reusability and maintainability, simulating enterprise UI development.
                     `,projectImage:o},memeGen:{projectName:"Meme Generator",projectDesc:`
                        Developed a responsive meme generatot web application using React, HTML and CSS. Implemented by creating 
                        the data for the memes locally and accessed it as a object. Used component based design for reuasbility 
                        and maintanability.

                        content was displayed by mapping over an array of data (appData).
